When i embarked on the mission to begin educating myself as a software engineer late in 2022, my "programming" knowledge amounted to little more than excel 'if statements' taught by years of study at the "University of Googling".  

In hindsight, it actually offered some preparation for entering the programming domain, but as you'd imagine its value was exhausted very (very) quickly.

While deciding where to begin the self-study journey, i was torn between either paying for a bootcamp or putting my trust in free content on the internet.  I put off the decision for as long as I could, but in the end opted to hold off paying out cash in favour of trying courses with zero cost.  

It seemed a huge risk to commit unknown amounts of my (bounded) time to courses that might turn out to be a dud.  Fortunately, the excellent open source coumminity in the programming domain, one I hope to eventually contribute to,  has self-starters covered with many course options available.

In my case, I enrolled in Harvard University's Computer Science online course known as 'cs50x', as taught by David Malan and his excellent team.

What follows is a synopsis of 'cs50x' and the other Computer Science courses i have studied thus far.  I intend to share more detail concerning my thoughts, opionions and learnings in individual blog posts.


### cs50x - November 2022 - March 2023

Harvard's one-stop-shop online CS course for the 'self-studier'. While the content is fed in bite-size chunks to allow complete CS newbies to follow its procedural programming, there was a wave of inital panic when failing to run the first C program.  Stout resolve was needed here as I plodded my way through 6 weeks of C Language programs (I'm better for it), followed by three weeks of Python programming.  The investent in time was well rewarded with programming knowledge and skill that has kick-started my ability to problem solve and given me the confidence to tackle more complex programming challenges.

### How to design data - Easy - January 2023 - ongoing
Never judge a book by its cover, nor a CS course by its name!   
While the name mentions 'Easy', it is anything but that.  My introdcution to 'functional programming' was (eventually) enlightening, as this course equipped me with a repeatable process for  successfully writing short recursive functions decomposed to a single action.  As I write this


### Python 4 Everyone / Automate the Boring Stuff - January 2023 - February 2023
I studied these two python courses as prep for completing the python section in the cs50x course i was already studying.  

### cs50x Python - September 2023 - Ongoing

### Programming Languages - Part A 


### Books
