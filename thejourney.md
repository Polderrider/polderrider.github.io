When i embarked on the mission to begin educating myself as a software engineer late in 2022, i started with "programming" knowledge that amounted to little more than knowledge of excel 'if statements' taught by the "University of Googling" over the years.  

In hindsight, it offered some preparation for entering the programming domain, but as you'd imagine its value was exhausted very (very) quickly.

While deciding where to begin the self-study journey, i was torn between either paying for a bootcamp or putting my trust in free content on the internet. I put off the decision for as long as i could, and in the end opted to hold off paying out cash in favour of trying courses with zero cost.  

It seemed a huge risk at the time to commit unknown amounts of my (bounded) time to courses that i had no idea would even  successfully teach me.  Fortunately, the open source coumminity in the programming domain has self-starters covered with many course options available.

After deliberating for some time while i read, and re-read, course reviews, it came to pass that i enrolled in Harvard University's Computer Science online course, or more precisely the resourceful 'cs50x' course taught by David Malan and his excellent team.

What follows is a synopsis of 'cs50x' and the other Computer Science courses i have studied thus far.  The goal here is to be brief.  I intend to share more detail concerning my thoughts, opionions and learnings from each in individual blog posts which you can find here if interested.


### cs50x

Harvard's one-stop-shop online CS course for the 'self-studier'.  Hang on tight! While the content is fed in bite-size chunks to allow complete CS newbies, as i was, to follow along, there is the customary wave of inital panic for the uninitiated when running your first C program.  Stout resolve was needed here as I plodded my way through 6 weeks of C Language theory (yes, memory management and all!), but with David Malan as your guide it never felt overwhelming.  

The final three weeks of the 9 week course (plus final project) covered Python both programming and as a vehicle for front-end development with bootstrap / flask and cstomary look at the holy trinity of CSS / HTML / JAVASCRIPT.  All in all, a throughly rewarding investent which equipped me with foundational programming chops that have served me well in solving programming problems
