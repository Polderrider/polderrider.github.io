When i embarked on the mission to begin educating myself as a software engineer, i started largely with prgramming knoeledge that began (and ended!) with 'if statements' built on an inifinite amount of googling techniqes voer the years.  In hindsight that actually offered some preparation for entering the programming domain, but really only a very little.

FOrtunately, with some online searching you can quickly uncover a staggeing amount of free self-study content on the internet.
