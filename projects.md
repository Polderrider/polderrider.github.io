## Skills gained from 12 months of computer science and programming study

**Understanding of Programming Fundamentals**   
Solid grasp of core programming concepts, including data types, loops, conditionals, functions, boolean logic and recursive functions for lists.  In the second year of my study (2023/24), I will refactor existing  programs targeting cleaner and more readable code using advanced syntax such as the conditional ternary operator, lambda functions and list comprehensions among others.

    
**Knowledge of Multiple Languages**    
I have built beginner to intermediate proficiency and knowledge in C, C#, C++, Python, and Flask. I am able to write simple programs and understand code written in these languages.   


**SQL Knowledge**   
Working knowledge of SQLite3 which was used to implement the back end for a web app project. Strong grasp of database design fundamentals and the common SQL commands needed to implement a CRUD app.


**Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**   
Familiar with the principles of OOP having written C# and Python programs with classes and constructors.


**Data Structures**    
Possess knowledge of and ablity to use basic data structures like arrays, lists and Hash Tables in my programs. I consider it a crucial skill to be able to manipulate and work with these data structures as a pre-requisite for moving onto more complex structures such as linked-lists, stacks and queues and eventually binary trees.


**Web App Development**   
Created Flask web applications with web API connection.  Created a Stock Tracker web app offering features to log-in, view current share price for Nasdaq listed companies, buy/sell shares, add additional funds to account and view transaction history of shares bought/sold.  Currently implemented in local browser with planning to host on server for internet access.


**Debugging Skills**     
Experienced in using debuggers to identify and fix errors in code.


**Problem Solving and Algorithm Practice**   
Regularly practice 'easy' level coding problems on LeetCode / Codeforce / HackerRank to sharpen problem-solving skills and expose myself to more complicated programming techniques.


**Version Control**     
Understand version control systems fundamentals and how to use them to manage and update code.  Able to collaborate on code using GitHub.


**Reading and Understanding Code Documentation**   
Comfortable reading and understanding code documentation and libraries in languages already studied.


**Understanding of Software Development Process**   
Possess a general understanding of the software development lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
