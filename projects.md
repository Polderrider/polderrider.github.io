## Skills gained from 12 months of computer science and programming study

**Understanding of Programming Fundamentals**   
Solid grasp of core programming concepts, including data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and boolean logic.    

    
**Basic Knowledge of Multiple Languages**    
I have built beginner to intermediate proficiency in C, C#, C++, Python, and Flask. I am able to write simple programs, understand code written in these languages, and switch between them.   

  
**Understanding of Data Structures**    
Knowledge of and able to use basic data structures like arrays and lists. I consider it a crucial skill to be able to manipulate and work with these data structures.  


**Basic Problem-Solving Skills**    
I can tackle simple to intermediate programming problems and implement solutions using the languages you've learned.


**Debugging Skills**     
I have experience of using codepsace debuggers to debug code to identify and fix errors.


**Version Control**     
You should have a basic understanding of version control systems like Git and how to use them to manage your code.


**Experience with Web Development (Flask)**   
If you've been working with Flask, you may have created simple web applications or web APIs, which is a great achievement.


**Basic Algorithm Understanding**   
You should have an introduction to algorithms and their importance in programming. Understanding basic sorting and searching algorithms is a good start.


**Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**   
Familiarity with the principles of OOP is valuable, especially if you've been using languages like C#, C++, and Python, which support OOP.


**Git and Code Collaboration**   
Being able to collaborate on code using Git and platforms like GitHub or GitLab is important in a real-world development environment.


**Reading and Understanding Code Documentation**   
You should be comfortable reading and understanding code documentation and libraries in the languages you've studied.


**Basic Knowledge of Databases**   
If you've been working with Flask, you might have some exposure to databases. Understanding the basics of database design and SQL is beneficial.


**Understanding of Software Development Process**   
You should have a general understanding of the software development lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.


**Problem Solving and Algorithm Practice**   
Regularly practicing coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or HackerRank can help you sharpen your problem-solving skills.


**Understanding of Code Efficiency**   
An awareness of writing efficient code and optimizing algorithms for performance is valuable.
